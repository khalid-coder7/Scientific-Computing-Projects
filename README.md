# Scientific Computing and Simulation Projects

This repository contains a collection of personal projects I developed to explore scientific computing, numerical methods, and simulations. These projects are independent of my undergraduate curriculum and are driven purely by curiosity and experimentation.

## Projects

### 1. Phase Space Simulator
A Python-based simulator for visualizing 2D dynamical systems, fixed points, and invariant manifolds.

### 2. Nonlinear Pendulum
Simulations of pendulum dynamics beyond small-angle approximations, exploring multiple stable and unstable points.

### 3. Billiards Simulation
A 2D billiard simulation modeling collisions and trajectories.

### 4. Waves Simulator
Numerical modeling of wave propagation in 1D and 2D media.

### 5. LaTeX Simplifier
A Python tool to parse and simplify LaTeX expressions symbolically, integrating with SymPy for computation.

## Features
- Interactive visualizations using Matplotlib
- Modular code for reuse in other simulations
- Examples of numerical methods: Runge-Kutta, Euler, finite differences
- Emphasis on understanding physics through computation

## Usage
Each project folder contains its own README with detailed instructions, dependencies, and example scripts.

## Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, SymPy
